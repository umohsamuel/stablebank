          <p>Not everyone is ready for change. But you are.</p>
          <p>
            You&lsquo;re part of a new generation that earns in dollars, spends
            in euros, and saves in rupees. Traditional banking is stuck in the
            past, making you pay for living in the future. That&lsquo;s why we
            built StableBank â€“because those who take control of their financial
            destiny deserve more than what traditional systems offer.
          </p>
          <p>More freedom. More trust. More rewards.</p>
